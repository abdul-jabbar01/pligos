Pligos installation is super easy. If you have already installed the helm (to install helm follow the instructions [here](https://helm.sh/docs/using_helm/#installing-helm) ), then you can simple install this as **helm plugin** by following commands:

For **OSX**
```
helm plugin install https://github.com/real-digital/pligos/releases/latest/download/darwin_amd64_pligos.tar.gz
```

For **Linux**
```
helm plugin install https://github.com/real-digital/pligos/releases/latest/download/linux_amd64_pligos.tar.gz
```
